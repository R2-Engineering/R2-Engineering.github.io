                        <p>I have an innate need to know how things work. When something
                            breaks, I need to understand the components that make up the
                            thing so I can visualize how to take it apart and put it back
                            together. Whether its a toy, an appliance, a motorcycle, or a
                            <span class="jeep-hover">1982 Jeep CJ-7</span>, I thrive on diving deep and learning as much as I can about
                            the thing. <br><br>It probably sounds a little crazy, but I’m not
                            happy when everything is working well and nothing needs
                            fixing. I’m most comfortable when I have multiple different
                            “pet projects” going at once. I never run out of things to
                            research and read about. New forums to discover and stories
                            from others doing something similar and learning how to avoid
                            mistakes that others have made. My goal isn’t to watch a video
                            and then do it exactly like everyone else. My goal is to learn
                            enough about what makes something tick, so that I can dive in
                            and get my hands dirty and figure it out as I go. That’s the
                            fun part.

                            I struggled with models as a kid. They are a great idea, and
                            I know a lot of people that love them. When I’m forced to
                            follow a very long set of specific instructions and produce
                            a thing that looks just like the box, I’m bored before I
                            even start. Give me a box of random electrical and plumbing
                            parts, any day, and I’ll whip up a
                            <span class="lamp-hover">desk lamp</span>

                            was an electrician. He was my guy. When I was a junior on
                            high school, I enrolled in an electro-mechanical tech
                            program at our community college and spent half of every
                            school day there for the next 2 years. Did you know that
                            there are actual competitions for electrical? Kids bending
                            conduit, fastening it to walls with switches and lights, and
                            a guy judging them and giving out awards. No shit. It’s a
                            real thing. And
                            <span data-hover-electrical="" class="bio-hover">a real thing that I did</span>
                            and placed 2nd at state.

                        <p>
                            I got a scholarship at the same college for electrical
                            engineering. I ate up the advanced math and anything to do
                            with engineering. The other stuff required for a degree ….
                            Not so much. Since college, I’ve worked as a maintenance
                            engineer at several factories, fixing CNC machine motor
                            controls, and any other industrial piece of machinery. A
                            residential electrician wiring new construction houses for a
                            subdivision. An electrician and electrical engineer at an
                            ambulance and rescue vehicle manufacturer. A validation
                            engineer, contracted at
                            <span class="pfizer-hover">Pfizer</span>,
                            where I reviewed PLC code and validated what was in the
                            documentation against what was running live in production.
                            Then as an automation engineer there, designing HMIs,
                            writing code, and managing a fleet of specialized computers
                            for the automation environment.

                                Then I went to work with a friend of mine that had started a
                                managed IT services company. We started in his basement and
                                grew it from the two of us to over 20 people with two
                                different offices across the state. I went from being the
                                onsite network engineer for a dozen clients, to the COO
                                managing a dozen engineers, to the Chief Growth Officer,
                                researching new technologies and vendors and creating
                                strategic partnerships to help the company grow. Sales
                                wasn’t my thing, and I had already trained up my replacement
                                COO who was doing a great job, so I inadvertently worked
                                myself out of the company I had helped build over the course
                                of 17 years. I sold my stake in the company in 2023 to
                                branch out on my own so I could work with a different set of
                                clients in a different capacity.

                <p>Google Workspace Migration: I migrated a
                                    large Michigan public library from
                                    on-premise Linux servers to Google
                                    Workspace. The project included email, docs,
                                    and several aging servers that we were able
                                    to decommission entirely. The migration went
                                    smoothly and modernized a significant chunk
                                    of their IT infrastructure. As a bonus, I
                                    set up the administrators with Google GAM
                                    (Google Apps Manager) so they could manage
                                    the new environment via command line - just
                                    like they were used to in Linux. They hadn't
                                    heard of GAM before and were pretty excited
                                    when I surprised them with it.</p>

                                    Sheets, and Sites. It gave their staff and
                                    CFO exactly what they needed, and as a
                                    nonprofit, the solution was free since I
                                    built it on tools they already had. The
                                    system worked well and stayed in use for
                                    many years as their daily front desk
                                    solution.</p>

                <h2>Newmind Group</h2>
                <p>HaloPSA Implementation: Newmind was moving
                                    to a new Professional Services Automation
                                    platform (HaloPSA) to streamline billing,
                                    accounting, service desk ticketing,
                                    documentation, sales, and marketing across
                                    the entire company. I led the entire project
                                    - from assessing solutions and meeting with
                                    vendors, to making the final selection and
                                    managing implementation. The biggest
                                    challenge was working with every department
                                    to understand their workflows and adapt them
                                    to the new platform, then migrating and
                                    consolidating data from over a dozen
                                    different systems. Years of valuable service
                                    desk tickets needed to be exported from
                                    Zendesk, cleaned, organized, and imported
                                    into Halo. I wrote a custom Python script
                                    using both the Zendesk and Halo APIs to
                                    handle the migration. Go Live was a success
                                    with zero downtime - everyone stayed
                                    operational throughout the entire process.</p>
